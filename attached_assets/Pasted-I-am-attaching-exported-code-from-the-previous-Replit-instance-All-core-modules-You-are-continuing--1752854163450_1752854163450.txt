I am attaching exported code from the previous Replit instance.
All core modules
You are continuing the Findawise Empire
You MUST use and connect the existing codebase. This is a handoff from one Replit instance to another. Work as if you are a senior developer in a billion-dollar empire—no shortcuts, no duplications, only modular, clean execution.

Do NOT compress or summarize code to save tokens. Output maximum quality and completeness.

When complete, output a new README, list what is done/missing, and export all code.

This must be robust, scalable, secure, and ready for full analytics & compliance.
Your New Mission :
You MUST:

Build a Localization & Multi-Language Engine for the Findawise Empire:

Add config-driven language and locale management (en, fr, es, hi, etc.)

Auto-translate all static and dynamic content (pages, offers, forms, blog, emails, dashboards) using a free/open API or local engine for v1

All modules must support multi-language rendering and user-selectable language switcher (with auto-detect and manual override)

Fallback to default language and allow manual overrides in config

Integrate multi-language support in analytics/events for global stats

Add localized routing and SEO meta (hreflang, sitemap updates) for language-specific pages (subfolders or subdomains)

README.md must be 100% English and fully document localization setup, translation logic, integration, SEO, troubleshooting, and export/import for next phase

No skipped steps; this must be ready for real global scale

hat You Must Build:
1. Config-Driven Language Engine

Central config for supported languages/locales (en, fr, es, de, hi, etc.)

Per-page, per-offer, per-form, per-content translation keys (modular, scalable)

Language switcher UI—auto-detect browser/user locale, allow manual override

2. Auto-Translation Layer

Use free/open API (Google Translate API demo, LibreTranslate, HuggingFace, etc.) or local engine for v1

Auto-generate translations for all static/dynamic content:

Page titles, descriptions, offers, CTAs, forms, blog content, emails, dashboards

Fallback to default (English) if translation missing; allow manual override via config

3. Full Integration

All major modules (generator, emotionMap, AffiliateOfferRenderer, LeadCaptureForm, blog, dashboards) must support multi-language rendering

All analytics/events tagged with language/country for stats/optimization

4. Localized Routing & SEO

Optional: Add subfolder (/en/, /fr/, etc.) or subdomain logic for language-specific pages

Update meta tags, hreflang, and sitemaps for Google/Bing localization/SEO

5. README.md (MANDATORY, English Only)

Full documentation for localization config, translation engine, multi-language setup, integration, SEO best practices, export/import, and troubleshooting

Clear instructions for adding new locales, content, offers, and dashboard support
